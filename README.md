# PokeAPI-Quiz
 A quiz that selects 2 pokemon and ask questions related to their stats
Created an Inital Quiz that selects 2 random pokemon and ask 4 predetermined questions about their stats
After the question is answered it will print if the answer was correct or not and shows the stats of the Pokemon

now have changed it to give a random question every time and ask if the user wants another question, next need to work on usability when nothing or an error is inputted into the answer field and need to add special attack and special defense

added the above to make sure answers to question is given and added special stats
